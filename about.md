Hi, I'm Moritz and I like tinkering with computers.

I put stuff I don't want to forget on this website. It's my exocortex.

An exocortex is formed by "any mental memory or processing component that
resides outside your physical brain." (Andy Hunt)

It's being served from a [Raspberry Pi Zero
W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) located in my
living room.
