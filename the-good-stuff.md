This is a carefully curated collection of resources about programming and
adjacent topics that I found to be real treasures. It's an attempt to save them
from getting buried and forgotten in my messy piles of bookmarks, favorites and
notes spread over different apps and services and at the same time share them
with whomever might find them useful.

I categorized the resources into the following sub pages:

- [Architecture](/the-good-stuff/architecture.html)
- [Human Factors](/the-good-stuff/human-factors.html)
- [Infrastructure](/the-good-stuff/infrastructure.html)
- [Java](/the-good-stuff/java.html)
- [JavaScript](/the-good-stuff/javascript.html)
- [Math](/the-good-stuff/math.html)
- [Programming](/the-good-stuff/programming.html)
- [Python](/the-good-stuff/python.html)
- [SQL](/the-good-stuff/sql.html)
- [Tools](/the-good-stuff/tools.html)
- [Vim](/the-good-stuff/vim.html)
